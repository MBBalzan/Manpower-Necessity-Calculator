# Manpower-Necessity-Calculator
This is an Excel project done during the beginning of the pandemic to prove the need to hire more manpower on a key area of a company. The data used on this project was altered to protect any company information.

## Context
During the pandemic, production fell short of the monthly goal 3 months in a row, so Management asked for a study on the case. Me and my team gathered info about absenteeism on the area, average hourly production per employee and the manpower costs, and I built this "calculator" with variable input values so it could be used for any variation on the future.

## Gathering data

### Absenteeism
The absenteeism data was gathered by the area leadership, responsible for keeping track of motives given for absence. Due to the pandemic, the motives were separated in 5 groups: Vacation, Covid-19, Sick note (unrelated to Covid-19), Absence (without justification) and Other. With this information I calculated an average of "real" manpower during the 3 months prior to the start of the project.

### Average Hourly Production (UPH)
The UPH was automatic calculated on the company's ERP.

### Manpower costs
The salary of each position was given by Management.

## Building the model
In order to facilitate changing the core data, the model was built first creating the main values
