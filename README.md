# Manpower-Necessity-Calculator
This is an Excel project done during the beginning of the pandemic to prove the need to hire more manpower on a key area of a company. The data used on this project was altered to protect any company information.

## Context
During the pandemic, production fell short of the monthly goal 3 months in a row, so Management asked for a study on the case. Me and my team gathered info about absenteeism on the area for the base positions (named only "Employee" on this project), average hourly production per employee and the manpower costs, and I built this "calculator" with variable input values so it could be used for any variation on the future.

## Gathering data

### Absenteeism
The absenteeism data was gathered by the area leadership, responsible for keeping track of motives given for absence. Due to the pandemic, the motives were separated in 5 groups: Vacation, Covid-19, Sick note (unrelated to Covid-19), Absence (without justification) and Other. With this information I calculated an average of "real" manpower during the 3 months prior to the start of the project.

### Average Hourly Production (UPH)
The UPH was automatic calculated on the company's ERP.

### Manpower costs
The salary of each position was informed by the Production Manager.

## Building the model
In order to facilitate changing the core data, the model was built first creating the main values
